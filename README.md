# installing-libraries-c
This repository will be part 1 of a two part project to show how to install custom libraries using cmake and micromamba

The purpose of this repo is to show how to create a C library for use in other projects and to make it easy to install with either cmake's "FetchContent_Declare" or micromamba.
